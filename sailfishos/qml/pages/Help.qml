So it is not possible to determine if a user has the rights to change content. You should now by yourself if you are resoponsible for a project language. If you have not enough rights to change something, you will get an error message, but it is not possible for Framrekkari to check this in advance.<br><br>The second big limitation is, that there is no search functionality. You have to enter the correct slug (project name that is used in the browser URL) to open a project directly, or you can browse through all available projects.")
